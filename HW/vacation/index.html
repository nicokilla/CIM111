I've always been obessed with soccer, My whole life revolved around that as a child growning in up Colombia. All I ever watched was Barcelona games and football matches. I quickly became addicted to it and then as i grew up studying Architecture and Design I learned about vast history of Barcelona the different locations. The culture and ultimately the on going battle to separate and divorce from Spain. Barcelona has always been a dream to visit. Watching a soccer match and site seeing around "La Sagrada Familia" a church that has been undergoing contruction for years. and will never be done due to the original structure of the design. Barcelona is top 1 in my list of travel plans in my future.
